This tries to generate some fancy pseudo unofficial transcript through Columbia's SSOL system.

It currently works by copying and pasting the transcript page into a text document, and it parses out the GPA from that

Working on a tkinter GUI and taking in login information so it is more seamless

Also, generate graphs!~
